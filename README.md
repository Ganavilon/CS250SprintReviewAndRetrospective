# CS250SprintReviewAndRetrospective

When determining what the user wants and how to incorporate that into a program, we have some tools and methods that we can use. We can start with the user stories and from that we can develop a program to meet those needs. Based on the user stories we can also determine a priority for them, if more users are interested in one aspect, then that part will be given a higher priority. When approaching a program that needs to be created, I start with planning. From this I can create a basic shell of a program that I can then modify to meet what is needed in the current program. I do like working on a program in small sections and then weaving those different parts all together. I can test the small parts for their functionality and then move on to the next part and incorporate them as I go. To be a good team member in software development can mean different things to different people. To me is means you have to ability to perform your role and support those that are on your team. Kind of like what I would expect from a tester. They work with the developers and from that they get a better understanding of the underlying program and can better develop test cases for it.
